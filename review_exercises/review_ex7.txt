Exercise7

Ex7a:
--------
Create a function that prints "hello world". Call this function from your main program.


Ex7b:
--------
Create a function that accepts two arguments (x, y) and that prints out "hello world func2". The
function should also print out the values of x and y.

Call this function from your main program.


Ex7c:
--------
Create a function that accepts three arguments (x, y, z) where z has a default value of 10. The
function should print out "hello world func3". It should also print out the values of x, y, z
including labels indicating which variable you are printing out.

Call function3 with two positional arguments.
Call function3 with three positional arguments.
Call function3 with three named arguments.
Call function3 with one positional argument and two named arguments
Call function3 as follows func3(7, 9, y=8). Observe that this generates an exception; gracefully
handle the exception.


Ex7d:
--------
Call function3 using *args in other words:
func3(*my_list)

where my_list is a three element list


Ex7e:
--------
Call function3 using **kwargs in other words:
func3(**my_dict)

Where my_dict is a dictionary that contains three key-value pairs corresponding to x, y, and z.


Ex7f:
-------
Write a function4 that takes three arguments (x, y, z) and returns x + y + z

Call function4 using three integers; print the value returned from the function
Call function4 using three strings; print the value returned from the function


Ex7g:
--------
Write a function5 that takes a function (my_func) as an argument. Function5 should call my_func()
three times and return None.
