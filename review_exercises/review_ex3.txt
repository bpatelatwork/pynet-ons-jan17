1. Take the following router output:

output = """
Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
FastEthernet0              unassigned      YES unset  down                  down    
FastEthernet1              unassigned      YES unset  down                  down    
FastEthernet2              unassigned      YES unset  down                  down    
FastEthernet3              unassigned      YES unset  down                  down    
FastEthernet4              10.220.88.20    YES NVRAM  up                    up      
Vlan1                      unassigned      YES unset  down                  down    """

2. Make a variable in your program from it.

3. Use splitlines() to split the above output based on each line
4. Find the line with the '10.220.88.20' IP; only print this line
